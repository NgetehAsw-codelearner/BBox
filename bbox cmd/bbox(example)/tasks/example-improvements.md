# SIPNOTUL Web Application Improvements

## Task Overview
This document tracks the improvements made to the SIPNOTUL (Sistem Pencatatan Notulen) web application during Blackbox AI development sessions.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Index Page Authentication Status
**Problem**: Navigation didn't reflect user login status
**Solution**:
- Added dynamic navigation based on authentication state
- Logged-in users see: greeting, Dashboard, Account, Logout
- Non-logged-in users see: Login, Register
- Implemented proper logout functionality with confirmation

### 2. Demo Notes Ownership
**Problem**: All demo notes appeared for all users
**Solution**:
- Updated demo notes to be owned by specific users
- Added `getNotesByAuthor()` function to filter notes by author
- Dashboard now shows only user's own notes
- Fixed author ID references (2101, 2102, etc.)

### 3. Delete Note Functionality
**Problem**: No way to delete notes from dashboard
**Solution**:
- Added `deleteNote()` function to storage.js
- Added delete buttons to note cards with danger styling
- Implemented confirmation dialog before deletion
- Dashboard refreshes automatically after deletion

### 4. Account Manager Integration
**Problem**: account.html existed but wasn't integrated
**Solution**:
- Added "Akun" link to navigation when logged in
- Account page allows profile updates (name, email, role)
- Proper authentication checks on account page

### 5. Broken Buttons and Missing Functions
**Problem**: Various buttons lacked functionality
**Solution**:
- Fixed editor.js to use `authorId` instead of `author` name
- Updated viewer.js to show author information with role
- Added `getUserById()` function for proper author lookup
- All buttons now have proper event handlers

### 6. Notes Manager
**Problem**: Incomplete notes management system
**Solution**:
- Complete CRUD operations through dashboard
- Users can create, edit, view, delete their own notes
- Personalized statistics and note lists
- Proper ownership tracking

### 7. User Identity Awareness
**Problem**: App didn't know who was logged in
**Solution**:
- Enhanced `getCurrentUser()` functionality
- Dashboard shows user-specific data
- Navigation adapts based on authentication status
- User greeting and personalized content

### 8. Enhanced Viewer
**Problem**: Viewer lacked author information
**Solution**:
- Added detailed author information with role
- Format: "Dibuat oleh [Name] ([Role]) pada [Date]"
- Proper user lookup using `getUserById()`

### 9. Manage Page Implementation
**Problem**: Dashboard buttons were unresponsive, no dedicated page for managing all notes
**Solution**:
- Created new `manage.html` page with comprehensive note management interface
- Added `src/manage.js` with search, sort, and CRUD operations
- Updated dashboard navigation to include "Kelola Notulen" link
- Fixed "Lihat Semua" buttons to navigate to manage page instead of broken inline display
- Added manage page styles including grid layouts, statistics, filters, and toast notifications
- Implemented proper user-specific note filtering and actions (View, Edit, Delete)
