# Blackbox Directory (bbox/)

This directory contains files and documentation related to Blackbox AI tasks and operations for the SIPNOTUL project.

## Purpose

The `bbox/` directory serves as a dedicated space for:
- Task documentation and progress tracking
- Blackbox-specific configuration files
- Temporary files generated during AI-assisted development
- Task-related notes and instructions
- Development artifacts from Blackbox interactions

## Structure

```
bbox/
├── readme.bbox          # This file - directory documentation
├── tasks/              # Task-specific documentation (if needed)
├── config/             # Blackbox configuration files (if needed)
└── temp/               # Temporary files (if needed)
```

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Task Documentation**: Store task-related files and progress updates here
2. **Configuration**: Keep Blackbox-specific settings in the config/ subdirectory
3. **Temporary Files**: Use temp/ for files that may be cleaned up later
4. **Organization**: Maintain clear naming conventions for easy identification

## Current Tasks

### SIPNOTUL Web Application Development
- **Status**: Completed major fixes and improvements
- **Location**: Main project files in root directory
- **Documentation**: See TODO.md in root for task progress

### Key Improvements Made
- ✅ Fixed authentication and user identity awareness
- ✅ Integrated account management functionality
- ✅ Added proper notes ownership and management
- ✅ Enhanced viewer with author information
- ✅ Fixed broken buttons and missing functions

## Notes

This directory is specifically for Blackbox AI operations and should not contain core application code. Core application files belong in the main project structure (src/, *.html, etc.).

For questions about this directory structure or Blackbox operations, refer to this readme or create additional documentation files as needed.
